# CK3 COA Online Designer

An online coat of arms editor for Crusader Kings III, inspired by the in-game editor but with additional features:
- Native support for masks
- Copy and paste functionality
- Drag & drop for emblems
- Import and export coat of arms to and from the game using textual format
- And more enhancements to streamline the design process

This tool allows users to easily create, edit, and manage custom coat of arms for Crusader Kings III directly from their browser.

This is a **fan-made** project
